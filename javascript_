WORLD WIDE USAGE
  since starting measurement (~2013-2017) it is estimated that 0,2% of web users have JavaScript turned off (higher
  numbers usually do not subtract requests with JavaScript errors or requests from bots)
  0,2% is a negligible amount, some of the biggest websites do not or hardly work without Javascript
  pro disabling JS arguments:
    - speed
    - less traffic (no ajax)
    - maybe some security issues
