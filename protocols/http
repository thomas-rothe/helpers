		Request
			[Method name] [Local path of requested resource] [HTTP version]

			Bspe:
			GET /path/index.html HTTP/1.0

			Method names
				GET 	- requests a representation of the specified resource
				HEAD	- request same as GET, but doesn't request the response body; 
						useful for meta-information in response headers, 
						without having to transport the entire content
				POST	- new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI
				PUT	- the enclosed entity be stored under the URI; existing 
						resources are modified; if resource is not existing,
						then the server creates the resource with that URI
				DELETE	- deletes the specified resource.
				TRACE	- echoes the received request so that a client can see what
						changes or additions have been made by intermediate 							servers.
				OPTIONS	- returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the
						specified URL. This can be used to check the 
						functionality of a web server by requesting '*'
						instead of a specific resource.
				CONNECT	- converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP
						tunnel, usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted 
						communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP 
						proxy
				PATCH	- applies partial modifications to a resource
			Local path of requested resource
				- ist der Teil der URL, der nach dem host kommt, also die request URI)

	3) Header
		- in v1.0 sind alle 16 Header optional
		- in v1.1 ist von 46 Headern nur einer required (Host:)
		- aus Höflichkeitskonvention macht man requests mit folgenden Headern:
			From:
				- personal email address of whoever's making the request
			User-Agent:
				- identifies the program that's making the request
				- Format: "Program-name/x.xx" (x.xx is the version of the program)
				Bsp: Netscape 3.0 sendet "User-agent: Mozilla/3.0Gold"
		- typische (konventionelle) response-Header:
			Server:
				- analog zu "User-Agent:", gibt Server Software an
				- Format: wie User-Agent
				Bsp: "Server: Apache/1.2b3-dev"
			Last-Modified:
				- modification date of the resource that's being returned
				- It's used in caching and other bandwidth-saving activities
				- Format: Greenwich Mean Time
				Bsp: "Last-Modified: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT"
		- provide infos about request/response, or about the message body
		- Format: 1 Zeile pro Header, jeweils [NAME]:[BELIEBIG VIELE SPACES UND TABS][WERT]
			- und danach eine neue Zeile mit: CRLF
			- Header lines beginning with space or tab are actually part of the 
			previous header line, folded into multiple lines for easy reading
	4) Message body
		- ist optional
		- Anzahl der Zeilen ist beliebig
		- response: 
			- requested resource is returned to the client (most common use)
			- or perhaps explanatory text if there's an error
		- request: user-entered data or uploaded files are sent to the server.
		- If an HTTP message includes a body, there are usually header lines in the message
			that describe the body. In particular:

			Content-Type: 
				- this header gives the MIME-type of the data in the body
				Bsp: "text/html" or "image/gif"
			Content-Length: 
				- this header gives the number of bytes in the body
		- enthält zB:
			- file contents
			- query data
			- binary data
