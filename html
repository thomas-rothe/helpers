INPUT - ORDER OF ATTRIBUTES
	1. type (so you can instantly see what it is)
	2. id
	3. class (I like to keep 2 and 3 together as they are the most common js/jQuery selectors)
	4. name
	5. value (I like to keep 4 and 5 next to each other so you can quickly reference what input it is and it's value).
	6. All others (like checked, max-size, etc)
	7. style
	8. tabindex (I like 7 and 8 to be at the end as it's "non-relevant", in terms of the actual functionality, they are more styling/usability stuff, keep 'em out of the way!

HOW BROWSERS PARSE DOCUMENTS
    - Browser requests an HTML document "index.html"
    - Browser receives the HTML document "index.html"
    
    EXAMPLE 1
    "index.html"
    	<div>text 1</div>
    	<script src="document-write.js"></script>
    	<div>text 2</div>
    	<script>document.write('<div>Inline hi!<div>');</script>
    	<div>text 3</div>
    "document-write.js"
    	document.write('<div>Hi from file!<div>');
    - Browser starts to parse "index.html"
        - Browser reads the first div and does not output anything
    	- Browser reads the first script tag and
            - downloads the document "document-write.js"
	    - parses "document-write.js"
	    - executes "document-write.js" (writes '<div>Hi from file!</div>' to the document)
        - Browser goes on parsing "index.html" and reads in the second div
    	- Browser reads the second script tag and
	    - parses the inline script
	    - executes the inline script (writes '<div>Inline hi!</div>' to the document)
        - Browser goes on parsing "index.html" and reads in the third div
	- Browser has finished parsing the HTML
	- Browser outputs the page to the user as:
		text 1
		Hi from file!
		text 2
		Inline hi!
		text 3

    EXAMPLE 4
    
PLAIN TEXT FILES
	- can be embedded in HTML
	- are not parsed, neither as HTML nor JS nor anything else
	- are outputted by the browser exactly as they are
	e.g.:
		<object
		  data="file.txt"
		  type="text/plain"
		  width="500"
		  style="height: 300px"
		>
		  <!-- Only parsed (and displayed) if some error occures (like -->
		  <!-- HTML is not supported or a typo in the filename -->
		  <a href="html.txt">Link to the text file</a>
		</object>
JAVASCRIPT
	HTML4 and (x)HTML:
		<script type="text/javascript" src="javascript.js"></script>

	HTML5: omit the attribute rather than provide a redundant MIME type -->
		<script src="javascript.js"></script>
FORM
	SELECT
		<select name="cars">
			<option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
			<option value="saab">Saab</option>
			<option value="fiat">Fiat</option>
			<option value="audi">Audi</option>
		</select>
