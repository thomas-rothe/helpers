- all input and more information from every execution of the application (HTTP request, from command-line) gets
  converted into a Request object at a very early stage of the code
- then the Request crosses multiple layers
- then the Request gets to the application itself
- then the application generates a Response object
- the Response passes multiple layers until the answer is sent to the user


entry point is public/index.php; what happens now:
- Composer's autoload
- Laravel's cache gets loaded
- Laravel's bootstrap starts: application container gets created
- registering a few core services (kernel, etc.)
- instance of kernel is created 
    - either (for web requests) an instance of the web kernel
    - or (for console, cron and artisan requests) an instance of the console kernel
- request is created
- request is passed to the kernels handle() method
- kernel processes request throuh middleware (or "layers"; is middleware and layers the same here?)
- kernel handles exceptions
- kernel passes request to the page router
- the kernels method handle() returns a response object which gets returned to user
- page request is terminated

kernel
- determines environment the request is running in:
  - staging
  - local
  - production
  - etc.
- runs all the service providers
- defines the list of middleware that will wrap each request (e.g. core middleware for sessions and CSRF protection)

CAPTURE YOUR OWN REQUEST (VERY RARELY USED)
    $request = Illuminate\Http\Request::capture();
GET THE APP'S REQUEST OBJECT (DIFFERENT WAYS)

    class SomeController extends	Controller
    {
				public function index(Request	$request)
				{
            $request;
				}
    }
    
    $request	=	request();
    
    $request	=	app(Illuminate\Http\Request::class);
    
    $request	=	app('request');

    BASIC USER INPUT
        all()                                     returns	an	array	of	all	user-provided	input.
        input(fieldName)                          returns	the	value	of	a	single	user-provided	input	field.
        only(fieldName|[array,of,field,names])    returns	an	array	of	all	user-provided	input
        for	the	specified	field	name(s).
        except(fieldName|[array,of,field,names])  returns	an	array	of	all	user-provided
        input	except	for	the	specified	field	name(s).
        exists(fieldName)                         returns	a	boolean	of	whether	or	not	the	field	exists	in	the	input.
        has(fieldName)                            returns	a	boolean	of	whether	the	field	exists	in	the	input	and	is	not
        empty (has	a	value).
        json()                                    returns	a	 ParameterBag 	if	the	page	had	JSON	sent	to	it.
        json(keyName)                             returns	the	value	of	the	given	key	from	JSON	sent	to	the	page.
