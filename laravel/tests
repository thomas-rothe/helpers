tests in Laravel live in the /tests folder, where there are 2 files:
    - TestCase.php (base class intended to be extended by any application tests)
    - ExampleTest.php (which is a ready-to-run application test that will return green on any new app)

        <?php
        use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithoutMiddleware;
        use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\DatabaseMigrations;
        use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\DatabaseTransactions;
        class ExampleTest extends TestCase
        {
                public function testBasicExample()
                {
                        $this->visit('/')->see('Laravel');
                }
        }
        
RUN TESTS
    cd project-directory
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit
    
NAMING TESTS (like in PHPUnit)
    - by default, Laravel’s testing system will run any files in the tests directory whose names end with the word "Test"
    - only the methods in your tests with names that start with the word test will be run — or methods with a @test docblock
        
        public function test_it_names_things_well() { // Runs }
				
        public function testItNamesThingsWell() { // Runs }
				
        /**	@test	*/
				public function it_names_things_well() { //	Runs }
        
METHODS
    $this->visit('/welcome')->see('Laravel');            crawls the DOM of the given URL of the application and checks
                                                         for the word “Laravel”; if it finds it, the test will pass
