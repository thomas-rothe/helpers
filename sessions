PROBLEM
    a web application can't remember it's users (because HTTP is a  stateless protocol and connections only last 
    for one or maybe some seconds; each request is handled by a process or thread which terminates after maximum
    some seconds) -> things like a product cart are not possible, with HTTP you can not track users
SOLUTION
    the server creates a unique random number for each client and assigns this number to the client as his 
    session id (sid) (or "session token")
    
    client   -----request------>     server
             <--response + sid--
             --request + sid -->
             --request + sid -->
             --request + sid -->
                    ...
TERMINATION
    sessions can be terminated by both, the client and the server (the client can stop to send the sid, the server
    can stop to read it)
IMPLEMENTATION
    (seldomly used) URL rewriting
        append the URL with the sid
        E.g.:
            http://bla.com/index.html;jsessionid=0329u0948098rugjorgj
    (seldomly used) hidden form fields
    cookies
        E.g.:
            Response:
                HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                Date:Mon, 11 Apr 2011 15:00:00 GMT
                Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=0329u0948098rugjorgj; Path=/
                ...
            Request:
                GET /blu.html HTTP/1.1
                Host: bla.com
                Cookie: JSESSIONID=0329u0948098rugjorgj
