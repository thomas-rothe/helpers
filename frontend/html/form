INPUT - ORDER OF ATTRIBUTES
	1. type (so you can instantly see what it is)
	2. id
	3. class (I like to keep 2 and 3 together as they are the most common js/jQuery selectors)
	4. name
	5. value (I like to keep 4 and 5 next to each other so you can quickly reference what input it is and it's value).
	6. All others (like checked, max-size, etc)
	7. style
	8. tabindex (I like 7 and 8 to be at the end as it's "non-relevant", in terms of the actual functionality, they are more styling/usability stuff, keep 'em out of the way!
