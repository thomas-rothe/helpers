AUTHENTICATION
    a typical web appplication establishes a session but REST APIsare strictly stateless -> so there is no
    session
    IMPLEMENTATIONS
        Basic auth (basic access authentication)
            - client send in EVERY request a username and a password
            - username and password are sent in the format "username:password"; e.g.: "peter:test123"
            - username and password are sent in the HTTP-header
            - username and password are not encrypted but encoded in base64 (the reason why they are sent
                encoded is not for security but just because there could be characters which are not allowed
                in HTTP protocol and these characters have to be transfomed to allowed characters; base64 
                encoding is used as simple string conversion)
            - since username and password are only encoded they should be sent via https for security reasons
        Digest access authentication
        Asymmetric cryptography
        OAuth 1
        OAuth 2
        JSON web tokens
