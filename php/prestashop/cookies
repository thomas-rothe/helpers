The __set is a "magic method" not for use directly. Use this coding form instead:

$cookie->test = $params;
$cookie->write();

The __set() function will handle the assignment of the new member variable you have created. Likewise you can use:

global $cookie;
if (isset($cookie->test))
    // Use $cookie->test in your custom code
