Package
	- a (rather small) PHP library containing PHP source code
Packagist
	- is a repository for public PHP packages and is the default repo used by Composer
Composer
	- is a dependency manager
	- is used for autoloading (because it has its own autoloader)
	(- does compiler optimization)
	(- custom hooks into lifecycle events, such as application installed, updated, or first created)
	(- stability checking)
Dependency
	- applications and packages can have libraries they depend on: dependencies
	- dependencies also may have their own dependencies (and so on)
	- if you tell Composer that your application or package depends on a package,
	it will also make sure that you have all the dependencies of your dependency-package
