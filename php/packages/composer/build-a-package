DEFINITION
	- is a file you create in the root directory of your project
	- you write the packages you want into this file, the version can be a range, e.g.: any version from 2.4.X to 3.X
	- you can
		- write it manually
		- create it with: composer init
		- create or append it with: composer require somevendor/somepackage
EXAMPLES
	Example 1)
	a minimal composer.json only has to contain valid JSON:
		{}
		
	Example 2)
	a rather minimal composer.json only lists dependencies of your project:
		"composer require michaelKaefer/oauth2-wrike" creates:
		{
		    "require": {
			"michaelKaefer/oauth2-wrike": "^1.0"
		    }
		}
		
	Example 3)
	a more useful composer.json for a package example which
		- defines the package "symfony/process" v3.3 or higher for the package in production mode and
		- "symfony/var-dumper" for the package in development mode
		- several other infos which are mainly used by packagist.org to catalog packages
		{
			"name": "me/mypackage",
			"description": "A package to play with Composer",
			"authors": [
				{
					"name": "michaelKaefer",
					"email": "michael.kaefer@something.at"
				}
			],
			"keywords": ["testing", "playing"],
			"license": "MIT",
			"require": {
				"symfony/process": "^3.3"
			},
			"require-dev": {
				"symfony/var-dumper": "^3.3"
			}
		}
PROPERTIES
	Stability
		you can define branches instead of version(ranges)
		but if the branch is not stable you have to explicitly allow Composer to install it (the default stability is "stable")
			{
				"require": {
					"somevendor/somepackage": "dev-master"
				},
				"minimum-stability": "dev"
			}
	Conflicting packages
		if there are packages that do not work with your apllication or package you can prevent installing them ever
		{
			"conflict": {
				"somevendor/somepackage": "1.0.0"
			}
		}
	Suggestions
		packages that enhance your packages functionality can be suggested to users of the package while
		they install your package
		{
			"suggest": {
				"somevendor/somepackage": "1.0.0"
			}
		}
VERSION RULES
		exact versions				1.0.2
		wildcard			*	1.0.*			equivalent of >=1.0,<1.1
		ranges of valid versions	>	<2.0
						>=	>=1.0
						<	<1.1
						<=	<=1.0
						!=	!=1.0
						,	>=1.0,<2.0		, is like logical AND (defines multiple ranges)
						|	>=1.0,<1.1 | >=1.2	| is like logical OR
						, has higher precedence than |
		tilde operator			âˆ¼1.2				equivalent to >=1.2,<2.0.
