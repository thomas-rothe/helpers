- Composer allows you to define commands which will be run after a specified event
- for example after composer "create-project", "composer install", "composer update" etc.
- e.g.: in Laravel you could run your migrations, clean up assets, etc. after every "composer install"; so, to 
  get to production you only run "git pull ; composer install"
