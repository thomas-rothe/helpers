GENERAL
    Streams aren't a new idea at all. Many functional languages support them. The name 'stream' is used in Scheme, 
    a LISP dialect that supports these features. Haskell also supports infinite lists. The names are all used in 
    Haskell. A different but similar concept also exists in Python and in many other languages; these are called 
    "generators".

    These ideas have been around for a long time in the functional programming community. However, they're quite 
    new concepts for most PHP and Javascript programmers, especially those without a functional programming 
    background.
