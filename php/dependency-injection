injecting objects from outside into classes rather than creating them inside a class
3 ways:
    - constructor injection (an object’s dependencies are injected when it’s created)
    
        public function __construct(Mailer $mailer) {}
    
    - setter injection (the class exposes a method specifically for injecting	a	given	dependency)
    - method injection (one or more methods expect their dependencies to be injected when they’re called)
