- no $_GET and
- no $_POST arrays containing user-supplied data
- PHP won’t output any HTTP headers by default
- default settings are set to sensible values for local use (e.g. max_execution_time is set to 0 -> scripts won’t time out)
- output buffering is turned off
- and error messages are displayed in plain text rather than HTML
