HTTP RELATED
    - no $_GET and
    - no $_POST arrays containing user-supplied data
    - PHP won’t write any HTTP headers to the output by default
CONFIGURATION AND DEFUALT-BEHAVIOR RELATED
    - default settings are set to sensible values for local use (e.g. max_execution_time is set to 0 -> scripts won’t time out)
    - output buffering is turned off, instead PHP implicitly “flushes” all output immediately
        Explanation: Online performance can often be harmed by sending output straight to a browser, so instead
        output is buffered and sent in optimal-sized chunks when each chunk is full. Offline,
        this is not likely to be an issue, so blocks of HTML and other output from constructs
        such as print and echo are sent to the shell straightaway. There is no need to use
        flush() to clear a buffer when you are waiting for further output. You can still use
        PHP’s output buffering functions to capture and control output if you want; see the
        “Output Control Functions” section in the PHP manual for more information.
HTML RELATED
    - error and warning messages are displayed in plain text rather than HTML; you can override this by setting the
        runtime configuration like this:
            ini_set('html_errors', 1);
    - the current working directory is not the directory of the requested script but the cwd of time when the script was called
