HTTP RELATED
    - no $_GET and
    - no $_POST arrays containing user-supplied data
    - PHP won’t write any HTTP headers to the output by default
CONFIGURATION AND DEFUALT-BEHAVIOR RELATED
    - default settings are set to sensible values for local use (e.g. max_execution_time is set to 0 -> scripts won’t time out)
    - output buffering is turned off
HTML RELATED
    - error and warning messages are displayed in plain text rather than HTML; you can override this by setting the
        runtime configuration like this:
            ini_set('html_errors', 1);
    - the current working directory is not the directory of the requested script but the cwd of time when the script was called
