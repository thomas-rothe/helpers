DEFINITION
    a running program
    (there can be multiple running instances of the same program)
    (example: two processes of the "ls"-programm have different PIDs)
MULTIPROGRAMABLE SYSTEM
    - every process runs on the same physical CPU
    - the processes alternate: each one gets the CPU for ca. 0,00001 to 0,0001 seconds, then the next one gets it 
COMPONENTS
    - source code (compiled or not compiled)
    - input
    - output
    - state, consists of:
        - values of CPU registers (instruction address register, instruction register, status register, etc.)
        - values of the variables
    - virtual CPU (every process thinks he got the CPU on its own while in fact the processes alternate on the 
        same physical CPU)
INFORMATION THE OS PROVIDES ABOUT A PROCESSES
    - PID, every process has an uniwue process identifier, e.g. "2145"
