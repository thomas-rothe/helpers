       owner group other
Read     4    4    4
Write    2    2    2
Execute  1    1    1
No       0    0    0
You add the numbers together, when there are more privileges. So r-x would be 5, because 4+1 is logically 5

SYNTAX AND EXAMPLE
       chmod [sticky bit][owner][group][other] [filename]
       chmod 0700 filename.txt
       
STICKY BIT
       usually is "0", which means: no sticky bit

       example set sticky bit on a directory which is not executeable for "others"
              $ ll
              drwxrwxr--  1 michael michael    0 Nov 25 09:04 TESTDIR
              $ chmod 1774 TESTDIR ; ll
              drwxrwxr-T  1 michael michael    0 Nov 25 09:04 TESTDIR
       example unset sticky bit
              $ chmod 0774 TESTDIR ; ll
              drwxrwxr--  1 michael michael    0 Nov 25 09:04 TESTDIR
       example set sticky bit on a directory which is executeable for "others"
              $ ll
              drwxrwxr-x  1 michael michael    0 Nov 25 09:04 TESTDIR
              $ chmod 1775 TESTDIR ; ll
              drwxrwxr-t  1 michael michael    0 Nov 25 09:04 TESTDIR

       When a directory's sticky bit is set, the filesystem treats the files in such directories in a 
       special way so only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or root user can rename or delete 
       the file. Without the sticky bit set, any user with write and execute permissions for the 
       directory can rename or delete contained files, regardless of the file's owner. Typically this 
       is set on the /tmp directory to prevent ordinary users from deleting or moving other users' 
       files.
