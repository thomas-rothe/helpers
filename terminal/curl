VERSION

HTTP-REQUESTS
    MOST BASIC EXAMPLE
        curl www.google.com
    IMPORTANT OPTIONS
        -v 
            - same as "--verbose"
            - shows more information (HTTP method, version, headers, etc.) about the request and the response
            e.g.:
                curl -v www.google.com
        -X [request method]
            - used to specify a request method
            -X GET
                curl www.google.com (since "-X GET" is the default, this is the same as "curl -X GET www.google.com")
            -X POST
                curl -X POST http://requestb.in/example
                -d key="value"
                    - with POST parameters
                        curl -X POST http://requestb.in/example -d name="Lorna" -d email="lorna@example.com"
                        curl -X POST http://requestb.in/example -d @or_put_it_in_a_file.txt
            -X PUT 
                curl -X PUT http://requestb.in/example
            -X DELETE
                curl -X DELETE http://requestb.in/example
        -H [header]
            - send a request with a header specified as a string
                curl -H "Accept: text/html" http://requestb.in/example
        -c [filename]
            - if the response contains cookies we can store them (as usual in simple plain text) in a file to use them 
            for further requests
            - the filename "cookiejar.txt" seems to be some weird convention...
                curl -c cookiejar.txt http://requestb.in/example
        -b [filename]
            - if we got a file with cookies, we can send the cookies in a request
                url -b cookiejar.txt http://requestb.in/example
        -s 
            - silent: Don't show progress meter or error messages
        -o [filename]
            - output: write response body of HTTP request to the specified file instead of to STDOUT
