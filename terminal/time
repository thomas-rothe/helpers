EXAMPLE
    time ls
        outputs:
            file1.php  file2.php

            real	0m0.026s
            user	0m0.004s
            sys	    0m0.001s
OUTPUT
    real    "elapsed" or "real" (wall clock) runtime used by the process, in seconds.
            components of "real":
                  user time (means that process was in "running" status in user mode)
                + sys time (means process was using kernel)
                + time when process was in "ready" status (that means other processes get the CPU) 
                + time when process was in "blocked" status (means that process could not run cause it was waiting for I/O for exxample)
                ----------
                = real tim
    user    Total number of CPU-seconds that the process used directly (in user mode), in seconds.
    sys     Total number of CPU-seconds used by the system on behalf of the process (in kernel mode), in seconds.
