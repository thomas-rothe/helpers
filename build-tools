PURPOSE
    - faster page speed because of smaller files (minify and uglify files)
    - faster page speed because of less files (concatenate files)
    - compiling SASS and LESS files into CSS files
FUNCTIONS
    - concatenating CSS files to one CSS file and concatenating JS files to one JS file
    - uglify JS files (e.g: var myVariable = 1; gets rewritten to: var a = 1;)
    - minify CSS and JS code (removes whitespaces and line breaks, etc.)
    - prefixing CSS rules, e.g.:
            a {
                display: flex;
            }
        gets rewritten to:
            a {
                display: -webkit-box;
                display: -webkit-flex;
                display: -ms-flexbox;
                display: flex
            }
    - compiling SASS and LESS files into CSS files
    - detecting errors in JS files with special tools like JSHint
    - live refresh (reload browser which has opened the site)
